              <h2>Trouble Game Rules</h2>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Trouble is a simple game for 2 players. According to Trouble game rules, the goal of the game is to be the first player to your piece from “Home” to “Finish.”</p>
              <h3>How to Play</h3>
              <p>Click roll the dice to determine which player goes first. The player with the highest roll goes first and play proceeds clockwise (to the left).
              Trouble game rules state to move your piece from Home to Start, you must roll a 6. If you do not roll a 6, then your turn is over. Once one piece has been moved from Home to Start, you move your piece around the board based on the number rolled on your turn.</p>
              <p>Pieces move around the board clockwise (left). You must count each space you move, whether it is empty or full. If you are able to land on a space that has an opponent’s piece, your opponent’s piece is sent back home. This includes an opponent’s piece being on “Start” when you roll a 6 and are able to move a piece from “Home” to “Start.”
              </p>
              <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
              <p>Per Trouble game rules, to win the game, you must be the first player to move your piece into the Finish. You must roll an exact number to move your piece into the empty “Finish” spot. If you roll a higher number than you can move, then your turn is over and your piece does not move. Pieces do not move around the board a second time.</p>
